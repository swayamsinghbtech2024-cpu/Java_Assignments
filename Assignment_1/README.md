Assignment 01: Menu-Driven Arithmetic Calculator

Description

A modular Java application that performs basic arithmetic operations through a user-friendly, menu-driven interface. This project demonstrates clean code organization, method decomposition, and robust input validation to prevent runtime errors such as division by zero.

Features

Menu-Driven Interface
Implements a switch-case structure to provide an interactive console-based user experience.

Input Validation
Uses the Scanner class with proper validation checks to ensure only numeric inputs are accepted.

Modular Design
Each arithmetic operation is implemented in a separate static method:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Error Handling
Includes explicit validation to prevent division by zero and handles invalid user choices gracefully.

Program Flow

The program displays a menu with available arithmetic operations.
The user selects an operation.
The user enters two numeric values.
Inputs are validated to ensure correctness.
The corresponding arithmetic method is invoked.
The result is displayed.

The user is prompted to perform another calculation or exit the program.
