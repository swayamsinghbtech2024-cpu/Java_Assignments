Assignment 01: Menu-Driven Arithmetic Calculator
Description:
A modular Java application that performs basic arithmetic operations. The project emphasizes clean code structure, method decomposition, and robust user input validation to prevent runtime errors like division by zero.

Features:
Menu-Driven Interface: Uses a switch-case structure for an interactive user experience.
Input Validation: Employs Scanner checks to ensure only numeric values are processed.
Modular Design: Each arithmetic operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) is encapsulated in its own static method.
Error Handling: Explicitly checks for division by zero to maintain program stability.
Logic Flow:
The program displays a menu of operations.
The user selects an option and provides two numeric inputs.
The program validates the inputs and calls the corresponding modular method.
Results are displayed, and the user can choose to perform another calculation or exit.
