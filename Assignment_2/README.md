Assignment 02: Vehicle Class Implementation
Description:
This project demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, specifically focusing on Encapsulation, Constructor Overloading, and Array of Objects. The goal is to manage vehicle data securely using private members and public accessors.

Key Features:
Encapsulation: Implementation of private data members to protect object state, accessible only through public Getter and Setter methods.
Constructor Overloading: * Default Constructor: Initializes objects with placeholder values.
Parameterized Constructor: Allows custom initialization at the time of creation.
Copy Constructor: Creates a new object as a carbon copy of an existing one.
Behavioral Methods: Simulated vehicle logic including start(), stop(), drive(), calcMileage(), and changeSpeed().
Object Arrays: Managing multiple Vehicle instances using a structured array for batch processing and display.
File Structure:
Vehicle.java: The blueprint class containing data members, constructors, and methods.
VehicleMain.java: The driver class that instantiates objects, populates the array, and handles output.
