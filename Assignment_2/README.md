Assignment 02: Vehicle Class Implementation

Description

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, focusing on:
Encapsulation
Constructor Overloading
Array of Objects
The objective is to manage vehicle data securely using private data members and controlled access through public methods.

Key Features
Encapsulation

All data members are declared as private to protect the object’s internal state.
Public Getter and Setter methods provide controlled access and modification of data.

Constructor Overloading

The Vehicle class includes multiple constructors to support different initialization scenarios:
Default Constructor
Initializes object attributes with placeholder or default values.
Parameterized Constructor
Allows object creation with custom values at the time of instantiation.
Copy Constructor
Creates a new Vehicle object as a replica of an existing object.

Behavioral Methods

The class includes methods that simulate real-world vehicle behavior:

start() – Starts the vehicle

stop() – Stops the vehicle

drive() – Simulates driving action

calcMileage() – Calculates mileage

changeSpeed() – Modifies vehicle speed

Object Arrays

Uses an array of Vehicle objects to manage multiple vehicles.

Enables structured storage, iteration, and batch display of vehicle details.
